MEL TODO List
Evan Pezent (epezent@rice.edu)

This TODO list contains things that need adding to MEL, cool ideas, and general thoughts.
It should not be confused as a change log or road map, and it is not intended for public consumption.
For those curious, the list is maintained using the Sublime Text package PlainTasks.

CTRL-ENTER - new task
CTRL+D - mark done
CTRL+SHIFT+A - archive


All:
  ☐ Documentation!

Communication:
  ☐ Write Linux implementation of SharedMemory
  ☐ Add methods for vector to Packet (just use underlying in loop?)
  ☐ Make MelNet not use packets (for string at least)
  ☐ BTP? http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5089429/

Core:
  ☐ make safety check functions more descriptive
  ☐ add Clock to PdController, generalize for all exos

Daq:
 ☐ a class that derives from VelocitySensor, but takes in a PositionSensor and performs dirty derivation

Q8 USB:

Error:

Utility:
  ☐ add json parser? header only on github seems good
  ☐ add CSV header only lib
  ☐ Write Linux version of Mutex
  ☐ ctrl handler Linux
  ☐ get_last_os_error(), make static functions not print
  ☐ Clean up / rethink StateMachine
  ☐ Socket.hpp includes winsock, which includes windows.h ... make SocketImpl.hpp
  ☐ async console printing (new thread, tcp/ip server, or something else?)

OpenWrist:

MELScope:

Long Term Plans/Ideas:
  ☐ entity-component based core library
