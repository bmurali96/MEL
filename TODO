MEL TODO List
Evan Pezent (epezent@rice.edu)

This TODO list contains things that need adding to MEL, cool ideas, and general thoughts.
It should not be confused as a change log or road map, and it is not intended for public consumption.
For those curious, the list is maintained using the Sublime Text package PlainTasks.

All:
  ☐ Documentation

Communication:
  ☐ Write Linux implementation of SharedMemory
  ☐ Add methods for vector to Packet (just use underlying in loop?)

Core:
  ☐ create class for amps

Daq:
  ☐ figure out how to do inheritance with the Channel classes

Q8 USB:
  ☐ on disable/close needs to reset settings to factory so current mode doesn't cause kick

Error:
  ☐ make an error output stream or something like that

Utility:
  ☐ add json parser? header only on github seems good
  ☐ Write Linux version of Mutex
  ☐ get_last_os_error(), make static functions not print
  ☐ Clean up / rethink StateMachine

OpenWrist:
  ☐ figure out how to nicely integrate separate OpenWrist project outside of MEL
